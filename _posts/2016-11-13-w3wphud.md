Heads-up display for viewing IIS worker process IDs in Visual Studio.

This was my first and only experience building a Visual Studio extension. It allows you to view Internet Information Services (IIS) worker process IDs at a glance within your IDE. It's essentially a wrapper for running the `appcmd list wp` IIS command and viewing its output. Useful when running multiple w3wp.exe processes, resetting ISS frequenctly, and determining which process to attach the debugger to.
